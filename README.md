# RETracker

`RETracker` is a reverse engineering framework for the [Polyend Tracker](https://polyend.com/tracker/) written in Python.
It is based on unofficial patches that are applied to the vendor's stock firmware.
These patches introduce a custom USB handler by replacing the Tracker's existing USB RAWHID handler. 

The `RETracker's` custom USB handler introduces new, non-official features to the `Polyend Tracker` that can be controlled from a computer via USB and also brings back file transfer functionality that has been [disabled by Polyend with the introduction of firmware v1.4.0](https://github.com/polyend/TrackerBetaTesting/releases/tag/1.4.0).

The `RETracker` firmware's basic features comprise the following:
* Reading/dumping of memory
* Writing/patching of memory
* Execution of custom code/redirection of control flow
* Writing files to the tracker's SD card
* Captivate the Tracker's main() function in a loop, while other RETracker commands keep working ("break")

These features are a solid base for adding further functions to the `Polyend Tracker` during run-time, by assembling position-independend code on the host, transferring it to the Tracker and having the new USB handler execute the freshly implanted code. There are a number of features available already that can be transferred dynamically to the device.
Make sure to [check them out](polyp/) and/or add your own!

Adding to that, the memory reading/writing functions allow the USB host to inspect the `Tracker's` memory by creating hex-dumps or by disassembling code in ARM or Thumb mode.

Finally, the file transfer function (currently the only direction implemented is *from* the USB host *to* the `Tracker's` SD card) allows new firmware files or `NES` roms to be copied to the Tracker, without having to go through the intended process of swapping the SD card between the `Tracker` and your computer.

HAPPY HACKING!
## Installation
First of all, on top of a Python 3 installation, RETracker requires a number of [dependencies](DEPENDENCIES.md) to be installed.
Please check them out and make sure you have them all installed before you go on.

Once all dependencies are installed, a patched firmware can be created by running [build_fw.py](build_fw.py).

```
# python build_fw.py
usage: build_fw.py [-h] infile outfile
build_fw.py: error: the following arguments are required: infile, outfile
```
Example:
```
# python build_fw.py PolyendTracker_1.5.0.ptf PolyendTracker_RETracker.ptf
MD5: ce894299bc35996186528364951c901e
Found 1 patch
Assembling patch #1
Description: "Memory dumping/patching/code execution/file transfer via USB"
Reading input file
Applying patch
Creating output file
Done
```
Once a `RETracker` firmware is successfully built, it should be copied to the `Tracker's` `"/firmware/"` folder on the root of its SD card.
The firmware flashing procedure is straight forward and doesn't differ from the ordinary process.

On the device
* press the `config` button
* go to the `Firmware` menu
* enter the `Firmware update` sub menu
* choose the firmware you would like to flash onto the `Polyend Tracker`

If the newly created firmware does not show up on the device, there may be a naming scheme for the firmware that must be followed (must start with `PolyendTracker_` and end with `.ptf`?).
If that is the case, renaming the file on your computer may help.
You're welcome! :D

ACHTUNG!!! It is normal for the UI to behave differently during the update process when flashing a patched firmware.
Please patiently wait for the update to finish until the device reboots.
In case something still went wrong, please consult the `Polyend Tracker` user manual, which explains the steps on how to enter the `emergency update procedure`.

## Supported Firmware Versions
RETracker currently supports `Polyend Tracker` in firmware version 1.5.0, which is the most recent firmware as of this writing.

## How does it work?
Polyend Tracker firmware images ship in intel hex format.
The [build_fw.py](build_fw.py) tool converts the firmware to its plain binary format, which holds all the firmware's code and data.
It then applies patches to the converted binary according to information found in [tracker/firmware.py](tracker/firmware.py) before converting the file back to intel-hex format again.
From there on, the `Polyend Tracker` can be communicated with by plugging it into a USB port of a computer running [retracker.py](retracker.py).

## RETracker Usage
The main workhorse of this project probably is `retracker.py`, which provides a command line interface to the user.
```
# python retracker.py -h
usage: retracker.py [-h] [-b] [-c] [-r ADDRESS SIZE FILE] [-w ADDRESS DATA] [-x ADDRESS SIZE] [-d ADDRESS SIZE]
                    [-a POLYP] [--polypargs POLYPARGS [POLYPARGS ...]] [-e ADDRESS] [-t SRC_FILENAME DST_FILENAME]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b                    break
  -c                    continue
  -r ADDRESS SIZE FILE, --readmem ADDRESS SIZE FILE

Whereas some of the more common command line options allow memory to be written, read and hex-dumped, the more exciting features are probably the `-e` and `-a` options.
They allow code to be executed on the device.
The `-e` option allows code to be branched to directly, for example after having written code/data to the device's memory using the `-w` option.
The lowest bit of an `address` argument passed to the `retracker.py` command line utility specifies whether or not to use Thumb mode (0: ARM mode, 1: Thumb mode).

The `-a` command line argument accepts so called `Polyps`, which are Python modules containing patches for the `Polyend Tracker` in the form of assembly routines and version-specific offsets and data.

Loading any of these modules using the `-a` command line option causes their assembly routines
* to be assembled on the fly
* transferred to the connected device
* executed on the connected device

Example:
```
# python retracker.py -a polyp.scroller
Connected to Polyend Tracker
Detected fw patch v0.3.0 on Tracker firmware v1.5.0

Assembling patch #1
Description: "Text scroller on the Tracker's pads"
Target address: 70100000
Mode: thumb
Patching memory
Running code...
Done
```

This does not only allow for convenient and sped-up development of custom code and features, it also does not require new firmware to be flashed onto the `Tracker` for new code to be tested (but a reboot in the worst case).

Please have a look at the available modules in the [polyp/](polyp/) folder, which contains a few initial demos that fade the `Tracker's` screen in and out or repurpose its pads as a text-scroller canvas.

## Reverse Engineering the Tracker
The `Polyend Tracker` is believed to be based on a µc similar to the Teensy 3.6 of which [data sheets and other tech info is available here](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html).
Be sure to check out the [MK66FX](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/K66P144M180SF5RMV2.pdf) manual for a memory map in order to avoid running into device crashes when dumping memory.
The `Tracker` firmware image is in intel-hex format and can be loaded directly by the [IDA Pro disassembler](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/ida-disassembler/) and probably others such as [GHIDRA](https://ghidra-sre.org/) or [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) using an ARM processor module in little-endian mode.
The firmware can be mapped to base address 0, with address 4 being a pointer to the reset vector (start disassembling there).
Most, if not all of its code runs in Thumb mode.
I've found address `0x70100000` and above to be a reliable address to plant a `Polyp` into and run its code from there.
